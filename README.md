## Problem:
When using TwinCAT3 as an EtherCAT master, connecting a slave and entering the Run Mode (DC synchronization), ***synchronization errors*** are often reported. At the same time, TwinCAT displays that the slave has reverted from the OP state to the SAFEOP state, and immediately returns to the OP stateã€‚ This can cause the slave to temporarily freeze during opeartion and sometimes even stop randomly in the SAFEOP state. Additionally, when scanning the slave and entering the Config Mode (or reverted from Run mode and then reset the slave to entering Config Mode or Free-Run Mode), it also stops randomly in the SAFEOP state, and it's necessary to try to re-scan to enter the OP state.
